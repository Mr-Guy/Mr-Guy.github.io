Today we watched a bit of the first harry potter film. It was the sorting hat scene. We watched it because in the lesson we were supposed to make our own sorting hat using code. We used the Microsoft coding language first where there was a tutorial on how to make a sorting hat. I was one of the first to finish the tutorial so i went to the front of the classroom. Then he told us we had to use javascript to make a sorting hat. This was a lot harder than using the microsoft coding language so we had to finish it for homework.

WWW: I learned how to use two types of code.

EBI: I could have listened more on how to code a sorting hat.
