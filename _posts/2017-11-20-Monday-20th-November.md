**Profit Is Key!**                                                                                          20/11/17

Starting Point: We have spent three weeks working on our virtual shop and it can process 10 orders at a time and add up the total. It can also add discounts like 20 percent off or 10 percent off.

Target for this lesson: To add a profit margin on each product and add a buy one get one free deal to certain items

Did I reach my target: Yes and no

Lesson Review

To start the lesson off I thought of how to add a profit margin in google sheets. My thought process was, what is a profit margin?, a profit margin is the sell price minus the buy in price. So if i put this is the code it would be, sell price - stock price. I put this into practice by adding a new column in my virtual shop in which i put the buy in price of each product, then i added a second column that had the code to calculate the profit from one purchase by a customer, of each product, the code for this was =

(cell name of cell with buy price) - ( cell name of cell with sell price). Drag this down through the column and it calculates the revenue of each product in my virtual shop 2017 simulator.

The second part of the lesson, making a buy one get one free deal for certain products in your shop, was a continuation of the last lesson. Although it was the second lesson i still feel I have got no closer to a final solution and everything i try comes up with an error message. But I guess there is always next lesson...

How did I learn?What strategies were effective?

I used the same method i used last lesson as i have found it quite effective. That method was visualising the core details of the code in word then putting those words into coding terms and functions to come up with a final answer.

What will I change for next time?How will I improve my learning?

Next time i will not use the internet for help with coding problems as doing this is hindering thought and logical reasoning and will be harmful to my learning and problem solving.
