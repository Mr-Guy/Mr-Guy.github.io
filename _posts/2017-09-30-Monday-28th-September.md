**Stepping things up a bit**                                                                25/9/17

Starting Point: I know how to use the vlookup command in sheets

Target for this lesson: To expand my learning of code in google sheets

Did I reach my target: Yees

Lesson Review

In today's lesson I decorated, moved and coloured the tables in which i had coded the translation program. I colour coded the tables into the original word in green and the enciphered message in blue. This made it easier to see where to put your message i also moved the letter reference into the corner so the main table was the focus when you looked at the screen. About halfway through the lesson our teacher called us to the front to learn some new code and expand our primitive knowledge (Alex and Jeremiah have a primitive knowledge) of google sheets.

What did I learn?What strategies were effective?

I learnt how to stop the error message when there is no letter in the vlookup command. I also learnt about concatenating. How to make several numbers concatenated and then how to unconcatenate them although that was a bit harder.
