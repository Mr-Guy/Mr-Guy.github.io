    <td>This lesson I learnt by reading the binary section of the coding book and rereading parts that I don't understand or asking my partners. I would do this while they are having a go at coding then when they are done I type in the code that is in the book and checking it for errors as I go along, I do this while my partners are reading the book. Then I run the code and if it works I move onto the next section but is it doesn't then I check the book and make corrections.</td>

    <td> What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>After trying the first way for a bit I got frustrated d with how long it took so I went faster through the book, that has limited my learning because instead of  reading the whole section I would read a little bit then carry on in the book. Then I would realise that I don't understand something I would have to go back and check earlier in the book. This didn't limit my learning but it did make me take longer when going through the book.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will not get too hasty and rush through the book skipping things when I get frustrated or bored. I will do the whole lesson in the same way as I started the lesson, by checking the section and rereading things I don't understand. I will improve my learning by talking more with my partners instead of letting them talk and me reading the book and then coding.</td>
