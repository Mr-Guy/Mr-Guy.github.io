**Virtual Shopping**                                                                                  6/11/17

Starting Point: We know some code and programs in google sheets

Target for this lesson: To make an automated virtual shop in sheets

Did I reach my target: Yes

Lesson Review

This week, we moved onto a new aspect of coding in google spreadsheets. Last half term we used commands like vlookup and concatenate but this half term we need commands for adding prices and multiplying prices by quantity. A Lot of the commands are the same such as vlookup and the iferror code are still very useful. But the new command we learnt was =sum, this is a very useful command as it adds up numbers quickly, saves time and leaves no room for human error. We used these commands and our knowledge to create a virtual shop that has products and prices for around ten items and can process a simulated shopping of these items. For example, you could say i want three apples and two oranges. Once you had selected the product and quantity the table would calculate the price of each set of items and then the final total.

What will I change for next time?How will I improve my learning?

Next time i will go beyond the work and find new objectives to achieve as this lesson all i did once i had finished was changed the layout of the table however if i had set a new goal such as making a discount on certain item i would have improved and stretched my learning.
