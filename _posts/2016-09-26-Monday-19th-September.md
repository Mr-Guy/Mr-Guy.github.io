  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by me and my group reading the coding book and discussing it so we understood what we had to do and how the code worked. Then we took turns typing the parts of the code into the computer then checking it worked and repeating  his till we had written all the code and it worked.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by getting distracted by typing different things into the computer instead of moving on to more advanced coding. I need to work on understanding the code instead of just typing what it says in the book. I also need to work on typing quicker because at the moment I am very slow.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will re-read certain parts of the book that I don't understand so I know what I am doing when typing in the code. I can improve by talking more with the people in my group instead of just coding by myself. Also I can improve by checking that I understand what each part of the code does and why there is certain commands.</td>
