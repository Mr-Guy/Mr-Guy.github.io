Today we learnt about the advantages and disadvantages of social media. Our teacher split the board into two halves on one side we wrote the advantages of social media and on the other side we wrote the disadvantages.

After that he gave us some pieces of paper with different scenarios on them, we had to order the scenarios in order of how bad or good they were.I thought the worst one was the one that said ,you told everybody you are on holiday and will be away for two weeks because if a robber saw that and knew where you lived they would steal from you..
