Today we looked at the homework from last lesson (planning the microbit game), he told us most of our homework was bad. So in the lesson we had to fix our homework in the lesson and we had to start building our microbit game. My game was quite complicated so i spent most of the lesson working on it. I had to figure out how to make the gun move in my game in the end i made it so when you tilt the gun moves. Also when you press a it shoots a bullet. Also if you hit the target you get +1 score and when 8 seconds is up it says your score then restarts.
