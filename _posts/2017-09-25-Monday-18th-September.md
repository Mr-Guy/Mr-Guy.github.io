**Welcome Back**                                                                18/9/17

Starting Point: It's a new year

Target for this lesson: To learn about coding in google sheets

Did I reach my target: Yes?

Lesson Review

In today's lesson we started our new project for this term and that is coding (typing code to make programs) and coding (enciphering messages). The lesson kicked off with a speech on dedication and commitment and what that means it IT with our new teacher Mr Tansley.

We first opened up google sheets then used a piece of code called =vlookup to turn words or phrases into coded messages using ciphers. The basic gist of it was making a list of letters from the alphabet then picking a word and using those letters at the start if the alphabet then filling in the letters and missing out the letters that have already been usedâ€¦ and eventually you will end up with two rows of letters that will make a coded message. The code we used, vlookup, in essence looks up the letters in the left column and the letters in the right column then finds the letter you asked it to and places it in a certain box. Then as an extension we could find a way to decipher a message using the vlookup command.

How did I learn?What strategies were effective?

I learnt by listening to the teacher and looking at how they used the code then using trial and error with some knowledge thrown in writing the same code so it works for me.

What will I change for next time?How will I improve my learning?

Next time i will completely recreate the code without copying as this lesson i did sneak a glance every now and then to copy some code when i should really be figuring it out myself.
