**Are you Good?**                                                                                    27/11/17

Starting Point: We are starting a new topic in IT.

Target for this lesson: To start creating an AI that takes responses and asks questions.

Did I reach my target: Yes.

Lesson Review

This lesson started by us revisiting a website we briefly used for coding in IT in year 8. Repl.It. Repl is a coding software that allows you to create a program in Python and many other coding languages for free. We started the lesson with a simple exercise, revising functions like print and input. We used these functions to make a program that asked if we were good and then received an answer of yes or no. However! We had a problem, if someone typed yes or no in block capitals it wouldn't understand the answer. To fix this, we used a command called .lower on the input then put it through the if, elif and else commands. This command successfully solved the problem and we could move onto improving and adding to the code.

We finished the lesson by making the code into a loop, either using True then breaks or making a variable equal to 0 then making it equal to 1 when we had received a valid answer.

How did I learn?What strategies were effective?

This lesson i learnt by visualising the processes I wanted to use to achieve my goal. This consisted of thinking that I wanted to make sure I got a valid answer to the question i was asking, then thinking of how this would work in a computing thought process, not continuing until you get a valid answer by reiterating the question until you get an answer you can work with. Then turning this into usable code, for example, having a variable equal to true until the answer is valid, then changing it to false allowing the loop to break.
