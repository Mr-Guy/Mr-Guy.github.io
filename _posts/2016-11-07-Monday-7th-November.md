  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by taking it in turns with my partners to code so that everybody got a chance to code. Then I would check the code by running it, if it did work I would carry on coding but if the code had an error I would fix it. Also I read the coding booklet and reread the things I didn't understand.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on typing faster so that I can get more code done and can carry on with the chapter faster and I can learn more. I also need to work on not looking at what other groups are doing and where they are at in the coding booklet because it distracts me from coding so I get less coding done.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will improve my learning by not looking at other people's work and getting on with coding my own work. I will also improve my learning by typing faster so I can get more work done. </td>
