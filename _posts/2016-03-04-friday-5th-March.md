Today we watched a video about two groups of people who were racing to get to 1 million views first. They each tried different things to get views such as hiding in a dustbin and scaring people, doing the cinnamon challenge and making someone sing a nursery rhyme. While they were at a party one of the people took  a video of two other people getting it on. They then posted it without realising the damage it would cause. When he posted it he got really unpopular and got angry messages. He then went to a website called ceop and that website helped stop the angry messages. They people who he filmed split up and the girl in the video went to childline for help. Our homework was to visit the ceop website and learn more about it.
