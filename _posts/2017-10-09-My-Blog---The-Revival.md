**Welcome Back - Week 1**                                                                18/9/17

Starting Point: It's a new year

Target for this lesson: To learn about coding in google sheets

Did I reach my target: Yes?

Lesson Review

In today's lesson we started our new project for this term and that is coding (typing code to make programs) and coding (enciphering messages). The lesson kicked off with a speech on dedication and commitment and what that means it IT with our new teacher.

We first opened up google sheets then used a piece of code called =vlookup to turn words or phrases into coded messages using ciphers. The basic gist of it was making a list of letters from the alphabet then picking a word and using those letters at the start if the alphabet then filling in the letters and missing out the letters that have already been usedâ€¦ and eventually you will end up with two rows of letters that will make a coded message. The code we used, vlookup, in essence looks up the letters in the left column and the letters in the right column then finds the letter you asked it to and places it in a certain box. Then as an extension we could find a way to decipher a message using the vlookup command.

How did I learn?What strategies were effective?

I learnt by listening to the teacher and looking at how they used the code then using trial and error with some knowledge thrown in writing the same code so it works for me.

What will I change for next time?How will I improve my learning?

Next time i will completely recreate the code without copying as this lesson i did sneak a glance every now and then to copy some code when i should really be figuring it out myself.

**Stepping things up a bit - Week 2**                                                      25/9/17

Starting Point: I know how to use the vlookup command in sheets

Target for this lesson: To expand my learning of code in google sheets

Did I reach my target: Yees

Lesson Review

In today's lesson I decorated, moved and coloured the tables in which i had coded the translation program. I colour coded the tables into the original word in green and the enciphered message in blue. This made it easier to see where to put your message i also moved the letter reference into the corner so the main table was the focus when you looked at the screen. About halfway through the lesson our teacher called us to the front to learn some new code and expand our primitive knowledge of google sheets.

What did I learn?What strategies were effective?

I learnt how to stop the error message when there is no letter in the vlookup command. I also learnt about  the first steps towards concatenating. Another aspect i learnt was how to make several numbers concatenated and then how to unconcatenate them although this was something that i found a bit more difficult.

**Concatenation (For real this time) - Week 3**                              2/10/17

Starting Point: I have had a few lessons on coding in google sheets and now have a general understanding of the code and methods.

Target for this lesson: To create a program that will concatenate a coded message and then unconcatenate the same message using code.

Did I reach my target: Almost.

Lesson Review

In today's lesson we reviewed our previous knowledge of concatenation and expanded this further as the aim of today's lesson was to make a program that concatenated then disassociated a message after you have enciphered the message using the previous programs. The first command to concatenate a message was essentially highlighting the letters in various boxes then putting them in 1 box.

Step 2 was creating 2 rows of code, the 2nd row was the numbers 1 ascending up to 18 and the first row was a piece of code that got the left letter times the number in the box below it so, for example, on the 3rd box along it would be left times 3 as there is a three in the box below it. This may not make sense now but it comes together as a program in step 3.

Step 3 was getting the right letter of the first box and then the second box on the right row got the 2nd right letter from the first box and so on. But the piece of code that makes this so clever is that when  there is no letters left it will stop adding letters to the box therefore only putting in the message that you want instead of repeating the last letter.

What will I change for next time?How will I improve my learning?

Next time i will spend more time coding and less time editing the layout of my code as in this lesson i got a bit behind editing the layout ad this may have impacted my learning and how much work i completed in the lesson.
