**Python Lists & Dictionaries**                                                        20/2/17

Starting Point: I am 38% of the way through the codecademy Python coding course on the section called lists & dictionaries.

Target for this lesson: To complete the section I am on.

Did I reach my target: Yes.

Lesson Review

In the lesson I continued with the Lists & Dictionaries section where I learnt how to make a for loop, how to sort lists, how to make a dictionary, how to add things into a dictionary and how to remove things from a dictionary. Then I finished the Lists & Dictionaries section with a lesson that reviewed the things I had learnt in that section. The next section of Python was called A Day at the Supermarket, the first part of his section was reviewing for loops and that is where the I finished. By the end of the lesson I was on 42%.

What will I change for next time?How will I improve my learning?

Next time I will read the information at the start of the lesson more carefully as all I do at the moment is skim read the information then do the task. This is bad as further on I will not know how to do something and I will have to check back.
