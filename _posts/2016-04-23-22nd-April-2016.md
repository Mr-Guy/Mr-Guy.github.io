Today we were told about something called a micro-bit. The micro-bit is a piece of equipment which is given to all the students in year 7 by the government. They have done this because they want to get kids interested in coding. Anyway, in the lesson on our computers we looked at tutorials of how to use different types of programming language. The programming language i liked the most was made by microsoft. Using that coding language i made a smiley face appear then disappear. After that i made it make a smiley face block by block then start again. By the end of the lesson i had made a piece of code that changes the brightness of the screen and showed an image.

WWW: I managed to make a piece of code.

EBI: I should have tried to do harder programming.
