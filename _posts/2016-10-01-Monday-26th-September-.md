    <td>I learnt by reading the coding book and understanding how the code worked then typing some of the code into the computer then I would let my partners check and change what I did wrong the I would run that part of the code to check for any bugs. I would then continue to write small parts of the code and check them until I had finished the section of code I was supposed to write, after that I would let my partners do what I'd did. I learnt about how to use strings in code and how to add two strings together to make a longer string.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by doing the easier coding instead of the more complicated coding, because when I tried the harder code I got it wrong and then i didn't know why so I went back over the things I had already checked and I think this limited my learning because I spent some time checking that I hold have spent learning the harder code. I need to work on letting my partners do some coding instead of just coding myself and I need to talk to them more when they are coding.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will spend less time coding and let my partner's code more because I probably spent more time coding than they did. I can also improve by spending more time on the things in the book that I found difficult instead of immediately going ahead when I think I understand something. And I can improve my learning by talking more with my partners when they are coding so I can help them or they can help me.</td>
