Lesson Review

In the lesson I continued with the codecademy Python course. At the start of the lesson I was on the lesson pyglatin and by the end of the lesson I had finished the lesson and had continued onto the next lesson about functions. In the pyglatin lesson I learnt what pyglatin is and I improved upon earlier knowledge about strings, variables and printing. In the lesson about function I learned what a function is, how to make a function, how to make one function use another function and when to use a function.

What will I change for next time?How will I improve my learning?

Next lesson I will not use hints at all or try not to use them as much. This is because i used a hint twice in this lesson when all I had to do was reread the instructions and check the code for any silly mistakes.
