**At Long Last**                                                                                            13/3/17

Starting Point: I am 42% of the way through the Python codecademy coding course.

Target for this lesson: To complete the exercise I am on.

Did I reach my target: Yes.

Lesson Review

In the lesson I continued with the 'A Day at the Supermarket' sections of the codecademy Python course. I have been stuck on the same exercise (called ‘Something of Value’) for 1 lesson and 1 homework. So, in the lesson I continued with this exercise, then 20 mins through the lesson the teacher called us to the front. He showed us a graph of how much you learn when you do blocks of work compared to doing a little bit often. The chart showing what you learnt when you did a little bit often was significantly steeper than the block learning one. Then, he showed us his coding of a game of battleships. 

After this I continued with the 'Something of value' exercise. Because I had been on this same exercise for a long time I thought it was just to ask the teacher for some help so that is exactly what I did. He told me that I had got 1 letter wrong, I had written ‘keys’ instead of ‘key’, I learnt that even though you think to words look the same a computer sees words as numbers not as letters so to the computer the words are completely different. This 1 bit of advice helped me greatly and by the end of the lesson I had completed 2 more exercises.

What will I change for next time?How will I improve my learning?

Next time I will check for errors of type in my code and not expect the computer to know what I mean as this lesson when I wrote the word 'keys' instead of ‘key’ I expected the computer to know what I meant but it didn't and this hindered me a lot.
