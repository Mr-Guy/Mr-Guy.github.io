**Number Functions**                                                                8/1/2018

Starting Point: We have recapped some python code from year 8.

Target for this lesson: To learn how to create more complicated programs by using functions.

Did I reach my target: Almost

Lesson Review

We started the lesson by looking at how the coding software python3 responds to number functions such as addition and subtraction. Then we created our own functions that perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. To improve our program we made it both more complicated and more accessible by making an input command at the start that receives two numbers from the user then adds them together. As a side note we also looked at how you could collect user inputs by making them into a function.

How did I learn?What strategies were effective?

I learnt by listening to the teacher and the teachers example of what we were programming then trying to create the same program myself. I also learnt by running the code, looking at any error, the solving the error.

What will I change for next time?How will I improve my learning?

Next time i will improve my learning by not looking at the board as much for help when i have an error with my code and instead i will solve the problems myself and learn from that.
