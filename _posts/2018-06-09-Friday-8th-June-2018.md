**Stepping things up a bit**                                                                25/9/17

Starting Point: This is our first my first lesson of IT for a while

Target for this lesson: To do something

Did I reach my target: Yeah

Lesson Review

In this lesson there wasn't really a class objective, what we were told to do was whatever we wanted in the boundaries of us learning and it being to do with coding.

But what was i doing in the lesson. With so much choice i was struck at first, what should i do? And then i said alright, i'll just do something, as i had sat there for like 5 minutes thinking and you don't learn by thinking. You remember.

So what i decided to do was rehash some old code from our old IT lessons, the original quiz was a buzzfeed style quiz which asked you some questions then gave you an answer you could look at and then tell someone else if you felt like it. I learnt how to change multiple variables to a new word in the context of a larger piece of code and how to edit and change functions.
