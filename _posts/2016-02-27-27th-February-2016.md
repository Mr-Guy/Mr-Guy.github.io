To create my identity map I had to really think because of some of the questions I had to answer about social media.On the questions like who's in your family and where have you lived were quite easy to answer but the questions like how are you going to use social media in the future, I had to really think about.I was ok about sharing my identity class with the rest of the class because most of the people in my class are nice and I didn't write anything too personal on my identity map.It didnt really feel that wierd commenting on the people in my classes identity maps because i knew everybody in the class. I didn't really enjoy this process because i would rather have said my comments to them and some of the things other people wrote on people's sheets were a bit mean. I was a bit worried getting the sheets back because i thought somebody might have written something mean.I was quite happy with what was on my sheet though because most of the comments were nice but i was a bit annoyed because somebody said your handwriting is bad.

This process is different from posting online because everybody in the class meet each other everyday but when you post online you will probably never see the person you are posting a comment to.Seeing other people's identity maps made me feel a bit like i was the only person who wasn't using social media because almost everybody said they used instagram or something like that.I don't use any social media at the moment so there isn't anything i want to change but i would like to start using social media.The 6 it lessons did change how i view social media in the future because i use to think social media was just posting things like pictures to your friends but now i realise you can also post videos.Also in the past i didn't really know what social media was.These lessons will change how i use social media in the future because i will know not to reveal where i live and things like that.
