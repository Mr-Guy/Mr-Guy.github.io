Today we carried on looking at javascript and the bbc microbit. On the bbc microbit website we followed tutorials on how to code things. Most of the tutorials did not work but it still helped. The first tutorial was to make a dice rolling game and i learnt about how to make random numbers. I can't remember the second tutorials. The third tutorial was called flashpoint, it helped us make a quick reflex game and i learnt about the microbit on command.

WWW:I learnt new commands.

EBI: I was a bit slow doing the tutorials.
