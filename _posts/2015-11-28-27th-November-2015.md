Today we made our own website in I.T. and our homework was to post our first post on our blog.

What Went Well:In the lesson I actually did everything right so my blog works and I did it all in good time .I also made a clever username and a password i can remember.

Even Better If:I did actually need a bit of help from my friend so next time I should do all the work on my own.I also got a bit distracted because of these weird pictures of pacman so next time I won't.
