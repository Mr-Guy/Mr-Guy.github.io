Today we worked more on our microbit games. My game is called Quickfire, me and my friend are working on it. In the game you have to press a to shoot a target as many times as you can in a time limit. My best was 63 but some people got a higher score. I learnt how to shorten code and about the right places to put if commands.

WWW: I finished my microbit game (partly)

EBI: I could have done more coding instead of playing the game.
