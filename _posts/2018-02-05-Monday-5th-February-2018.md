Starting Point: This is our third lesson (if you include the lesson we spent planning) on creating our buzzfeed-style quizzes.

Target for this lesson: To finish my quiz.

Did I reach my target:  yes

Lesson Review

We basically just spent the whole lesson coding, in fact not just basically we just spent a whole lesson coding. I had already completed most of it as the way i was coding my quiz wasn't very difficult, just if statements and inputs, and therefore the lesson was mostly just fixing errors and adding to the quiz. The first thing i changed was the input system, as it wasn't very easy to use, in it you had to type in the full name of the input and if you made any mistakes in spelling it then it would ask the question, o i changed it to asking a:something, b:another thing and c: etc. which made it easier to use and more fun. There was luckily only one problem with the quiz, it was that it kept re-asking 4th question. I found out the reason for this was quite simple, i had just put the wrong variable in the if statements. I also added a bonus round if you picked a certain answer to one of the answers on question six.
