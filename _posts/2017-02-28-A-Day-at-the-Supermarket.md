Lesson Review

This lesson started of as normal, we sat down, went on codecademy and continued with the Python coding course. I started the lesson on the 'A Day at the Supermarket' section. I completes half of this section that reviewed things like for loops lists and dictionaries. But, halfway through the lesson the teacher called us to the front of the classroom where told us about the structure of HTML coding. I learnt how to make a table in HTML and that HTML is a markup language. He then told us how to change the HTML of our individual blogs and how to change the text of specific areas or the whole thing. For homework we had to implement what he had told us into our blogs, spend 15 mins on codecademy and write a blog.

What will I change for next time?How will I improve my learning?

Next time I won't use the example as much on the codecademy lessons, this is what I need to improve because if I copy the example and change a few things I won't learn anything and I won't improve.
