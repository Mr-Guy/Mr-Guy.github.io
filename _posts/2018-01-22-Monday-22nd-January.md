**Run-length Encoding**                                                             22/1/18

Lesson Review

In this lesson we learnt about run-length encoding which is in essence stirling pixels is how many in a row and saying what colour they are. The reason why this helps is because it allows the image to be stored with less data used. The way this works is that when the data is stored as run-length code it only takes up two vits for describing each block of colour whereas in normal storage of images there are two bits for each pixel.

In the lesson we had to draw an image then convert it into run-length dat, eg(g) 4 white pixels then two blue pixels in a row would usually be stored as 2 bits for each pixel making 12 buts, but in run-length coding it would be stored as 4w 2b only using two bits.

Then we had to swap with other people and use the run-length coding to recreate another person's image.
