Today we watched an advert for Pepsi Max and we learnt about the hidden messages in the advert. Then we watched a video about mcdonalds and in the video it told you that the  burgers you buy in mcdonalds are the same as the burgers on the adverts. After that we played a game where he asked us questions and if we agreed with what he said we would go to one side of the classroom but if we didn't agree we went to the other side and if you were unsure you could go in the middle. This game proved that peer pressure makes people change their minds because some people went to one side then when they saw everybody was on the other side they changed their mind. Then he told us that people act differently on reality tv than they do in real life.

WWW: I understood the concept of different types of media and i was right when i said people act differently on reality tv.

EBI: When we were playing the game i changed my mind about one of the answers because everybody else had a different answer so i was affected by peer pressure.So next time i will go with my own answers.
