**Embedding Sheets and Videos**                                                       16/10/17

Starting Point: I have made a sheet that can encode, concatenate and decode messages.

Target for this lesson: To make this code into an easier to use experience.

Did I reach my target: Almost.

Lesson Review

In the lesson we were taught how to embed sheets or videos in or blogs. The way you do this is by if you are in a sheet going to the export to web section and copying the embed code into the bottom of the blog on github. If it is a video you go to the section underneath the video and use the embed code the same way you would use the embed code for a sheet.

The next target for the lesson was making our encoding and decoding programs into an easier experience. By this i mean making it so there is no code or lists of text just two boxes, one where you type in the message and a second with the encoded message. No copying and pasting of letters and easy to use. I almost got to this stage however some of my code was a bit wrong and i didn't fully complete the task by the end of the lesson.

How did I learn?What strategies were effective?

I learnt by listening to what the teacher had to say then trying out the techniques he talked about in practice and asking questions when i didn't understand something and i had done all i could to solve it.

What will I change for next time?How will I improve my learning?

Next time i will fix all the coding problems i have for homework as last week when my code wasn't working i left it until the lesson to fix it which hindered the progress i otherwise would have made in the lesson.
