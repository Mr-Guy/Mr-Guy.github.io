**A Day at the Supermarket                                           **6/3/17

Starting Point: I am 42% of the way through the Python coding course on codecademy.

Target for this lesson: To complete the exercise I am on.

Did I reach my target: Yes.

Lesson Review

In the lesson I continued with the 'A Day at the Supermarket' section of the Python codecademy coding course. In case you forgot I was on the ‘A Day at the Supermarket’ section last lesson as well. Anyway, the exercise was on was very difficult and I had to read and reread the information and instructions, look back through the previous exercises and look at the clue multiple times before I figured out what I had to do. So, I typed this in and to my joy the green bar came up saying exercise completed. Sadly though, the next exercise was even harder than the one before and by the end of the lesson I was still on this exercise.

What will I change for next time?How will I improve my learning?

Next time I will improve my learning by not getting distracted. This is my target because in the lesson when I found the exercise too hard/boring I would sometimes look around the room or see where other people were at. This does not help my learning and decreases productivity therefore next lesson I will try not to get distracted.
