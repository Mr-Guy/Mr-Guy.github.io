**Learning the basics**                                                                  17/17/17

Starting Point: I have just finished the chapter that was about Boolean coding.

Target for this lesson: To finish the next chapter.

Did I reach my target: No.

Lesson Review

How did I learn?What strategies were effective?

In the lesson we started the next chapter of the fuze coding book. I learnt by reading through the book with my group with one person doing the coding and the other two reading the book, then after about ten minutes we would swap round. But in this lesson we didn't understand the chapter we were working on so we talked to each other more than usual.

What limited my learning?Which habits do I need to work on?

My learning was limited by not working hard enough or fast enough through the coding book. I got distracted and that stopped me from working as fast. I need to work on getting on with my work instead of looking at other people's work.

What will I change for next time?How will I improve my learning?

Next time I will get more work done quicker and more efficiently by not looking at other people's work and by not getting distracted.
