**Buzzfeed Coding?**                                                             15/1/18

Starting Point: We have been recapping and learning python3 coding.

Target for this lesson:  To create the plans and logic for our own buzzfeed quiz.

Did I reach my target: Yes

Lesson Review

This lesson took a decidedly unexpected turn when we were told to go onto buzzfeed and do a couple of the quizzes. It all made sense though when we were told we were creating the logic (and then the code) for a buzzfeed type quiz. But before we started we, in a sense, analysed different ways the buzzfeed quizzes are coded and the logic used for them. There were various ideas for how it worked such a randomly generating a number, having an answer tree where depending on what answer you picked you would get a relevant question, weighting particular answers from the answers to a question and having a set number that is added or subtracted from based on the answer you picked. I chose the last option for designing my quiz.

The quiz i planned in the lesson was; Design a pasta dish and we will guess your age? In essence the quiz was just asking you various questions to do with aspects of a pasta dish and adding or subtracting to a base number of 18 from these answers. And i planned for after the code the age being printed and then after that depending on which age bracket you were in, e.g. 1-10 or 18-29 it would give you a statement about pasta.

How did I learn?What strategies were effective?

I learnt by analysing various ways the logic of buzzfeed quizzes were designed then using what i had deduced from this to create essentially a copy of the design and logic of a stereotypical buzzfeed quiz.
