Today our teacher opened one of the presentations we had done on prezi at random. After that he talked with us about what was good on the presentation and what was bad. I learnt that you shouldn't copy of the internet and to be careful about the colour of your background and the colour of your font. Then he showed us a really bad presentation from another class and pointed out all the things you should not do.

WWW: I learnt how to make my prezi better and now i know where the instructions are for prezi.

EBI: I realised that my prezi wasnt that could and i haven't submitted it properly.
