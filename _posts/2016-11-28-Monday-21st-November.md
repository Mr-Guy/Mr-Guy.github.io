Starting Point: I know most of the basics of fuze coding

Target for this lesson: to complete the next chapter

Did I reach my target: yes

Lesson Review

How did I learn?What strategies were effective?

In the lesson me and my group read through the chapter we were on and tried the coding that was shown in the book. We took it in turns to code and we helped each other by checking for mistakes while one person was coding. I learnt about Boolean coding about true and false in coding and the coding signs for less than or equal, greater than or equal and the not equal sign.

What limited my learning?Which habits do I need to work on?

My learning was limited by not working well as a team, I need to work on speaking with my group and conferring with them more. I need to work on helping my group if they are stuck or confused.

What will I change for next time?How will I improve my learning?

Next time I will talk more with my team and work with my team more. This will help me and them to learn more and know more.
