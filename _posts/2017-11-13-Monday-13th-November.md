Starting Point: This is our second half term doing spreadsheets.

Target for this lesson: To create a buy one get one free command in spreadsheets.

Did I reach my target: No

Lesson Review

In the lesson we continued with our virtual shopping simulator by finding a command or series of commands that puts a discount on the final price of our virtual order. This was obtained by having one box for the final price (before discount), a box with the discount percentage and then a final box for the price after discount. In the final price box it would be the same number as the already calculated sum of the price of every item. In the second box you could type the discount you wanted. For example 20 in the box would put a 20 percent discount on the total and 25 a 25 percent discount, you get the idea. Then, what the third box would do, the total after discount box, was get the total times the discount as a decimal. So, if the discount was 20 it would be 100-20 then dividing that by 100 to get 0.8. The command would then times this number by the previous total to get the new total after discount.

the second part of the lesson was an extension, the teacher asked us to find a way to put a buy one get one deal in our virtual shop. I first tried to make a command that would divide the price by two if the number was even or not divide if it was odd but i realised this was wrong so i made some changes to my code. I also looked through a database of commands that was in spreadsheets to see if there were any useful ones i could use in this work or maybe in future, however by the time i had decided what to do next it was the end of the lesson so i did not finish the buy one get one free discount code.

How did I learn?

This lesson i learnt by asking myself how to make a certain command then thinking about that command in terms of ifs equals and other code terms, after this i would try out the command and then change it according to what the error message said or what number the command produced.
