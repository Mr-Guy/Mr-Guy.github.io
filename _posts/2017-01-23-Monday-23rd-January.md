**Telling People Answers**                                                          23/1/17

Starting Point: I have started the codecademy Python coding lessons.

Target for this lesson: To complete the course I am currently on.

Did I reach my target: Yes.

Lesson Review

In the lesson we continued with the codecademy lessons. I completed the course I was on, the next course on and by the time the lesson finished I was on my 3rd course in that lesson.

In the first course I was finished in the lesson I learnt how to make a string all lowercase, make a string all uppercase, print the amount of letters in a string, make a number a string, how to combine strings and a lot more. 

The next course I got onto was about the date and time in coding. I learnt how to print the date and time, how to print the day, month, year, hour, minute etc. individually and how to print the date in a string.

The final course i worked on in the lesson was about conditionals and control flow. I learnt the coding sign for equal to, not equal to, less than, less than or equal to, etc. and how to use these symbols in coding.

Near the end of the lesson the teacher talked to us about telling people the answers and how bad it was for them and how you are helping them more if you don't tell them the answers. I believe that if someone is stuck, with coding or with anything you shouldn't tell them the answer but you should tell them what they are doing wrong instead. If you tell them what they are doing wrong they can learn from that and work towards the answer. 

Also if you copy and paste your homework from another website you aren't learning anything, all you are doing is showing the teacher someone else's work and you haven't learnt anything from it.
