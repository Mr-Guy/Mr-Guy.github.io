In our lesson we learnt about the different types of media and we learnt what media was.Our homework was to find hidden meanings in adverts.

WWW: I think i understood the meaning of media and i was good at finding hidden messages in car adverts and other adverts.

EBI: I could have done the homework a bit quicker and written more. And in the lesson i got a bit distracted because someone had taken my chair and given me a very low chair.

In the homework i did a car advert for the VW apollo which is normally a small type of car but the advert was trying to persuade you that it was a spacious car.
