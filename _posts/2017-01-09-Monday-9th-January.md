**Attitude to learning**                                                                          17/17/17

Starting Point: Our class has a new teacher and it is a new term

Lesson Review

In this lesson we were taught by a new teacher. In the lesson we filled in a survey about coding then were brought to the front of the classroom so the teacher could talk to us about the right attitude for learning in IT. At the end of the lesson we watched a video of a kid who tried something and failed, the teacher made him try again and again until he succeeded. What the kid was doing in the video isn't important, the important thing is that the kid tried again and again and in the end he succeeded. If he gave up after 1 failed attempt he would not have learnt anything so  the message is carrying on trying teaches more than giving up does.

How did I learn?What did I learn?

We learnt by the teacher talking to us about what the right way to learn is. He also showed us a video to get our attention and to reinforce on the point he was making. In the lesson I learnt that you should not have a device in the same room you go to sleep. I also learnt that it is not good to go on your phone/iPad/computer 1 hour before you go to sleep. The last thing I learnt in the lesson was that when you are learning something in IT or in any subject you should keep on trying when you don't succeed , never give up even when things get tough.

What will I change for next time?How will I improve my learning?

Next time I will be more resilient with my coding and keep on trying when i get something wrong. I will improve my learning by not giving up when I get a piece of code wrong and I will try everything before I ask the teacher for help.
