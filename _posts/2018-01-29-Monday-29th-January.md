**Starting the Coding**                                                             29/1/18

Starting Point: We have planned our BuzzFeed quizzes.

Target for this lesson: To start the coding for our quiz.

Did I reach my target: Yes

Lesson Review

In the lesson we first posted the link to our blogs for review then we got onto the main part of our lesson. Starting to code the quiz. We were asked if we needed to have some help to start our coding. We all did. So we came to the front and were shown various programs for no discernable reason and eventually landed on a blank document where we were given an example of how to not code the blog in a sequential way but instead in a way where the majority of the code was a form of a function with some arrays thrown in as well and the code performing the functions was relatively small.

I decided this was too complicated so i went to the old fashion way of sequential coding, just asking a question then changing a variable based on the response then asking another question and changing the variable based on the response and so on. This was a lot easier as i could copy and paste the general format of asking questions and receiving answers to make the whole process quicker.
