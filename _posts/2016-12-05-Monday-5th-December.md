**Flashing lights                **                                                              17/17/17

Starting Point: I am on the flashing lights chapter of the fuze coding booklet

Target for this lesson: To not get distracted by other groups and to finish the chapter

Did I reach my target: Yes

Lesson Review

How did I learn?What strategies were effective?

In the lesson we got out the equipment for the chapter we were on, we needed to get a plastic box that had all the LED's resistors and wires in it. We had to use this to help with our coding. We learnt by one person reading the booklet and telling people information, one person plugging in the wires and lights and the other person typing the code. Then after a while we would swap round. Near the end of the lesson we managed to finish the flashing lights chapter.

What limited my learning?Which habits do I need to work on?

My learning was limited by the group next to us doing the robot arm. This limited my learning because it was hard not to get distracted by the arm moving, picking things up and even writing with a pen. I need to work on not getting distracted more as I didn't properly achieve it this lesson.

What will I change for next time?How will I improve my learning?

Next time I will not get distracted by the other group doing the robot arm. Instead I will work harder and talk more with my group. This will help me to learn more and to work faster when coding.
