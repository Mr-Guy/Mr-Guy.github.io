Today we changed the script of our websites in the file named style.scss to make our websites different colours.To find the codes for the colours we looked on a certain website and then I used another website to get the best colours that go well together.I changed the font colour to black and the background to light blue.

What Went Well: In the lesson I managed to do everything right and not make any silly mistakes in the coding.I also helped someone else with their coding because  they were having a bit of trouble.

Even Better If: When i tried to load my computer I thought there was no chrome box but it turned out that it was a different type of Chrome box so next lesson I will look around more when I think there is no chromebox
