In today's lesson i carried on working through the tutorials on the microbit website. I learnt how to make a character and how to make things appear and disappear on a microbit. The 4th tutorial was called worst snake ever. You had to code a snake that you move and apples you have to collect. After that i did the 5th tutorial called quick finger. This was a reflex game which i finished at the end of the lesson.

WWW: I did two tutorials and they both worked.

EBI: I didn't work that fast.
